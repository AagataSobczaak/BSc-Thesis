Bachelor's Thesis Project 

This repository contains work related to my bachelor's thesis focusing on audio processing and machine learning methods for instrument recognition.
The project focuses on developing and comparing machine learning methods for recognizing musical instruments from audio data. 
It involves processing sound files, training models, and evaluating their effectiveness in classification task.

Data

The data used in this project comes from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/soumendraprasad/musical-instruments-sound-dataset/data
The dataset includes audio samples of musical four instruments: Drum, Guitar, Piano and Violin.

Workflow:

1. Preprocessing audio files.
2. Splitting the dataset into training and test sets.
3. Training multiple machine learning models: random baseline model, k - nearest neighbours (k-NN), logistic regression, naive Bayes, decision trees and theirs ensemble methods (random forest, bagging, boosting), neural networks (NN),  support vector machines (SVM).
4. Evaluating the models using key performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score and confusion matrix.
